## This is some more markdown

[I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com)
  
 URLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into links. http://www.example.com or <http://www.example.com> and sometimes example.com (but not on Github, for example).

 Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.

```rust
let s = "Rust syntax highlighting";
println!("{}", s);
```

```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```

```
No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting. 
But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.
```
