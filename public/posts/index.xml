      <description>This site was designed to be as simple and fast as possible.
 No client-side javascript No server management HTTPS only and no certificate management Source files for blog posts should be markdown Costs should be fixed  My previous attempt at this was based on The One Cent Blog. This used S3, Jekyll, Cloudflare, and Travis-CI (for triggering a bucket update when a new commit hits Github). It has the basic parts I wanted - a static site generator, and automated/free tools in front to manage certificates and do caching/DDOS protection, etc.</description>
